## üóÇÔ∏è Project Structure

FlutterFlow handles project structure visually, but here‚Äôs a logic breakdown:

- **Screens**  
  - `SignUp / Login`: Auth flow using Firebase  
  - `Home`: Display cars with filters  
  - `AddCar`: Upload car details and images  
  - `BookingSummary`: Show booking details  
  - `MyCars`: Owner can view & manage their cars  
  - `Notifications`: Firebase-triggered alerts  
  - `Profile`: User info & app settings

- **Collections** (Firestore)
  - `users`: name, email, role (owner/renter), points  
  - `cars`: model, price, image, ownerId, availability  
  - `bookings`: carId, userId, startDate, status  
  - `notifications`: title, userId, timestamp

- **Actions & Logic**
  - Firebase Auth + Page Redirect
  - Visibility conditions (e.g., only show bookings for current user)
  - Point system: user earns/uses points (stored as int)
